            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>McDan White Water Rafting began in 2010 with a simple idea — to share the thrill of river rafting and the
                beauty of
                nature with everyone.
                What started as a small, family-run operation with just one raft has grown into a trusted adventure
                company known for
                safety, professionalism, and unforgettable outdoor experiences.
                Over the years, we’ve expanded our team, upgraded our equipment, and explored new rivers, all while
                staying true to our
                roots — creating lasting memories and deep connections with nature.
                Our history reflects our passion for adventure and our commitment to providing every guest with an
                exceptional
                experience on the water.</p>
